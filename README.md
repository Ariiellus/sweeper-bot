# Sweeper Bot

This is an example of a sweeper bot commonly used to drain wallets which private keys have been exposed to internet.

The purpose of this bot is to show how it works and for local testing when trying to recover remaining assets from a compromised wallet.

The original repo belongs to [zeroXBrock](https://github.com/zeroXbrock/) member of [Flashbots](https://github.com/flashbots). This is a modified version of the original repo, with the following changes:

- The bot doesn't burn ETH.
- It sends all ETH to a specified address (attacker, in this case my testing wallet).
- The bot doesn't sweep other assets, only gas token.
- It hasn't been tested on mainnet or other networks.
